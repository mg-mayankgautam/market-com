                        SEO is a multi-faceted discipline that requires a strategic and ongoing effort. Here’s how we approach it at Tectonic:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Keyword Research & Strategy:</strong> We start by identifying the most relevant and high-impact keywords for your business. This involves analyzing search volume, competition, and user intent to ensure that we target terms that will drive the right traffic to your site.</li>
                            <li><strong>On-Page Optimization:</strong> Our team optimizes your website's content, meta tags, headings, and internal linking structure to ensure that search engines can easily understand and index your site. We also focus on improving user experience by enhancing site speed, mobile-friendliness, and content readability.</li>
                            <li><strong>Content Creation & Optimization:</strong> Quality content is the backbone of SEO. We help you create and optimize content that resonates with your audience, answers their questions, and encourages engagement, all while naturally incorporating targeted keywords.</li>
                            <li><strong>Link Building:</strong> Building high-quality backlinks is essential for improving your site's domain authority. We develop a customized link-building strategy that includes outreach to relevant websites, guest blogging, and earning links through content marketing and PR efforts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Technical SEO:</strong> We conduct a thorough technical audit of your website to identify and fix issues that may hinder its performance in search engines. This includes optimizing site architecture, improving crawlability, fixing broken links, and ensuring that your site is secure and compliant with SEO best practices.</li>
                            <li><strong>Local SEO:</strong> For businesses targeting a local audience, we optimize your online presence to ensure that you rank well in local search results. This includes optimizing your Google My Business profile, managing local citations, and ensuring consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) information across the web.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ongoing Monitoring & Reporting:</strong> SEO is not a one-time effort; it requires constant monitoring and adjustment. We provide regular reports on your website’s performance, including keyword rankings, traffic sources, and conversion rates, along with actionable insights to refine your strategy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Penalty Recovery:</strong> If your site has been impacted by a Google penalty, we have the expertise to diagnose the issue and implement a recovery plan to restore your rankings and traffic.</li>
